# This test checks for behavior when loading data from the config file is
# combined with the --bundle option. We expect this should break during
# bundle merging, since no bundle roots have been explicitly configured.
#
# NOTE: port 61413 was chosen at random, so that if we run in parallel with
# other tests, we won't fail to bind to the interface.
