## New!

**EOPA has been donated to the OPA community**, and we invite you to take a look around.

- Try EOPA if you have to integrate with databases including DynamoDB, Postgres, and Neo4j. See the full list[here](./docs/eopa/_eopa-introduction.md)
- Experiment with EOPA's performance improvements and share feedback in `#help` on [Slack](slack.openpolicyagent.org)
- See the [A Note from Teemu, Tim and Torin](https://blog.openpolicyagent.org/note-from-teemu-tim-and-torin-to-the-open-policy-agent-community-2dbbfe494371)
