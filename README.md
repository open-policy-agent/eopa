## New!

**EOPA has been donated to the OPA community**, and we invite you to take a look around.

- Existing OPA users can and should continue to use [OPA](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) as before.
- See the [A Note from Teemu, Tim and Torin](https://blog.openpolicyagent.org/note-from-teemu-tim-and-torin-to-the-open-policy-agent-community-2dbbfe494371)
  for more information.
